## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm a junior C++ programmer with a passion for exact sciences. Moreover, I have a highly developed sense of aesthetics, honed over the years through painting and computer graphics. As a result, my focus is not only on maximally optimized code, but also clean code.

Currently, I'm refining my skills in embedded programming, particularly with STM32. I am boldly entering the world of home and industrial automation.

Keep an eye on my GitHub profile, and familiarize yourself with my current projects as well as those planned for the future!
